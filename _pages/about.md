Our lab explores the intersection of AI and culture by developing computational tools that study and model cultural phenomena. We leverage cultural theory and critical insight not only to enrich AI systems but also to better understand AI itself as a cultural system. Recognizing culture as the infrastructure of the social world, we investigate how aesthetics, narrative, and interpretation shape social outcomesâ€”ranging from elections and misinformation to vaccine hesitancy and beyond. This collaborative work aims to reveal the causal and generative power of culture in shaping both society and technology.
