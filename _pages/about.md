How humans make sense of culture, and how we use culture to make sense of our world, are inseperable from the technologies that mediate these processes. Our lab explores this intersection through the idea of **cultural intelligence**, a term which captures both what we know about culture in a given context and how we know it. Increasingly, human cultural intelligence is mediated through computation, whether in the form of algorithmic feeds, large language models, or other advanced systems for controlling and distributing information.

We leverage **cultural theory, critical insight, and computational tools** to better understand the impacts of these systems on cultural intelligence and to devise strategies for responding to these impacts. Recognizing culture as the infrastructure of the social world, we investigate how aesthetics, narrative, and interpretation shape social outcomesâ€”ranging from elections and misinformation to polarization and beyond. Our research aims to illustrate both the causal and generative power of culture in shaping the alliances and divisions of contemporary society.
