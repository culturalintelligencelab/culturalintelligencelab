Our lab explores these complex dynamics through the idea of <strong>cultural intelligence</strong>, a term which captures both how culture is constituted at any given time and place and the ways we have for making sense of it. Increasingly, cultural intelligence is being mediated through computation in the form of algorithmic feeds, large language models, and other advanced technical systems.</p> <p>We leverage <strong>cultural theory, critical insight, and computational tools</strong> to better understand these systems, but also to diagnose their social effects and identify ways of enriching them with an attention to culture itself. Recognizing culture as the infrastructure of the social world, we investigate how aesthetics, narrative, and interpretation shape social outcomes—ranging from elections and misinformation to creative storytelling and beyond. Our research projects aim to reveal the causal and generative power of culture in shaping society and technology today.</p> <p>For more information or to connect with our lab’s activities, please email <em><a href="mailto:hoytlong@uchicago.edu">hoytlong@uchicago.edu</a></em> or <em><a href="mailto:richard.so@duke.edu">richard.so@duke.edu</a></em>.</p> </body></html>
